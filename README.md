Our project was to create a website that had information displayed from an API call. We decided to use NASA's API's and do a "this day on space" project. The website takes a user's date and searched the NASA API for that date. It brings up the nearest asteroid for that day, a POTD for that day and information for the picture of the day. As soon as the user enters a date a button is also created for that day and saved to local storage.
